            <h3><u>Why We Made This:</u></h3>
            <p>TIDE has a lot of different websites that we use as students and it can be difficult to remember and find the links to all of them. We created this website as a hub of all the different links in order to make navigating around easier.</p>
            
            <h3><u>Features:</u></h3>
            <p>All links have a picture with the logo of the website to make it easier for users to see what each one is. You can also hover over any to see the name of the website.</p>
            <p>Also, all links open in a new tab to prevent having to hit the back button.</p>
            <p>The order of the links defaults to A-Z, but as you use the website and click the links, it will automatically reorder based on which links you click on most. It can always be reset using the "Reset Link Order" button in the sidebar.</p>
            <p>Also in the sidebar is a link to the feedback form if you wish to give any feedback.</p>
            <p>There is also a search function at the top of the website where you can put in the website name or terms associated with the website to find it.</p> 
            <p>Along the top there are also common categories that you can sort by, such as Foothill that has all the links to relevant Foothill websites.</p> 
            <p>And along the side there are informational resources such as a link to the TIDE bell schedule and calendar.</p>
            <p>We have also included hotlines for students to call or text if they need, with sorting categories like 24/7, anonymous, or emergency services.</p> 
            <p>Also, we researched local teen clinics that students can go to for health support, with options to sort by city.</p>
